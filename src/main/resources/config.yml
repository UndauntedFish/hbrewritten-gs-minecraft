# cooldownbar_quality is essentially the "resolution" of the cooldown progress bossbar.
#     1 will update the bossbar every tick
#     3 will update the bossbar every 3 ticks
#    20 will update the bossbar every second (since 1 second = 20 ticks)
#    80 will update the bossbar every 4 seconds
#    ...etc.
#  A low number means the cooldown progress bar will be updated VERY frequently, making it look smooth.
#  A high number means the cooldown progress bar will be updated less frequently, making the game less laggy.
